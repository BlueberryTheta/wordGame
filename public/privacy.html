      <section>
        <p>Inqaily respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Usage data (pages viewed, basic interactions) for analytics.</li>
          <li>Local-only game state stored in your browser (e.g., guesses, questions, streaks). We do not receive this unless explicitly sent via the app.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cookies and Advertising</h2>
        <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for functionality and analytics. This site also uses Google AdSense to show ads.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Third‑party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this and/or other websites.</li>
          <li>Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
          <li>You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>AI Services</h2>
        <p>To operate the game, we send limited data to an AI service provider (OpenAI). Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When you ask a question, the question text and the secret word are sent to the AI to generate a brief answer.</li>
          <li>When you enter a guess, the guessed token may be sent to the AI to help validate whether it is a common English word.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use this data solely to provide the game’s functionality.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Server Logs and Hosting</h2>
        <p>We may record limited request information for security and debugging (e.g., the day key, questions/guesses you submit, timestamps). Our hosting provider may also process IP addresses and basic request metadata in access logs to deliver and protect the service.</p>
      </section>
